hiroshima072,UG12_Box43_Folder1344_19.pdf,Executive Order 9066 and Public Proclamations,Public Proclamation No. 3,"DeWitt, John L.","After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941, the United States entered World War II. There was a concern among some people in the United States that anyone of Japanese descent could be a threat to the security of the nation. This fear, though ultimately unfounded, led President Roosevelt to sign Executive Order 9066. This order authorized the Secretary of War to designate certain areas as military zones. Within a couple of weeks of Executive Order 9066, several public proclamations were released. The first two established six military zones along the West Coast, the third limited the freedoms of particular populations in those zones, and the began the forced evacuation of those deemed a threat to the United States, most notably anyone of Japanese descent.",2/19/1942,,military; proclamations,,,"UG 12, University of Idaho President's Office.

","A portion of those being removed from the West Coast were university students. Several universities in these areas had a large percentage of students with Japanese ancestry. Many of these institutions fought to ensure their students could continue working towards their degrees even after evacuation. The President of the University of California, Berkley, Robert Sproul sent letters to universities further inland asking them to accept these students. Due in part to the influence of Governor Chase A. Clark, who held strong anti-Japanese sentiments, no public universities in Idaho were able to accept these students.",4/1/1942,,correspondence; university; japanese students; relocation,,,"UG 12, University of Idaho Presdient's Office.

The majority of those were held at the WRA camp known as Minidoka  located near Hunt in southern Idaho, while a small portion were also sent to the Kooskia Internment Camp in the north which was run by the Immigration and Nationalization Service.

Moore to President Dale,"Moore, Don C.D.","Though many supported the actions taken by the U.S. Government to protect the country during a time of war, many opposed the actions being taken against the Japanese-Americans within the country. Some people in Idaho argued against the governor's decision barring access to out of state Japanese-American students wishing to attend Idaho universities, calling into question the constitutionality of such actions. Local clergy and organizations wished to ensure those of Japanese descent in their communities were being protected, and offer housing when possible. Though there was still a strong sense of anti-Japanese sentiment among people of Idaho, there were also those who opposed what was happening and did their best to help.",5/9/1942,,correspondence; anti-racism,,,"UG 12, University of Idaho Presdient's Office.

Three days later they dropped another bomb on Nagasaki. These bombings killed tens of thousands of individuals instantly and left the cities in rubble. The effects of these bombings would ultimately take the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Though they brought about the surrender of Japan, and the end of the war, these bombings had a a lasting effect on the Japanese people who survived them. With the end of the war, those with Japanese ancestry would soon be released from their incarceration camps stateside.

hiroshima033,MA2019-39_01.pdf,Japanese Reconstruction and the University,Request made by President Morito,"Morito, Tatsuo","The destruction caused by the atomic bomb was vast. In 1951, Hiroshima University was starting to rebuild and their president, Tatsuo Morito, reached out to institutions across the globe asking for help. He wished to establish his university as a Peace University, so there would be 'No more Hiroshimas.' Requesting a book for their university library to promote an atmosphere of universal friendship, and a tree for their campus, he hoped to achieve this goal. Morito hoped the trees would turn the red-dust left by the bomb green, symbolizing hope and growth. The University of Idaho responded to Morito's request with a book on silviculture, some seed samples, and $3 to plant a tree on their campus. The University of Idaho was only one of 8 instiutions in the U.S. to send seeds to Hiroshima, and one of 18 in the U.S. to send money.

hiroshima038,MA2019-39_06.jpg,A Gift of Remembrance ,Roof Tile,,"The small contribution the University of Idaho made to Hiroshima University's reconstruction, was long forgotten. In 2011, however, the Martin Institute on campus received a package from the university. It's contents held copies of the letters exchanged between the two universities in the 1950s, the manga series 'Barefoot Gen' recounting the destruction and reconstruction of Japan after World War II, and five roof tiles. The tiles had been blown off the roofs of building in Hiroshima during the atomic bomb and had been collected from the riverbed. This gift had been sent by a student group commemorating the gifts of those who helped them rebuild after the war on the 65th anniversary of the bombing. Their hope was to promote peace through the education and reminder of destruction of nuclear weapons.

hiroshima050,1997_weepingwhitemulberry_01.jpg,The Continuous Journey,Borah Foundation Peace Walk: Weeping White Mulberry,,"The receipt of these gifts from Hiroshima University prompted the creation of this exhibit to share the mostly forgotten story of how the University of Idaho sent a small gift to Hiroshima University during its reconstruction. In researching the exhibit the creator could not ignore what she found regarding the treatment of those of Japanese descent by Idaho and the University during World War II, thus this collection also discusses the Japanese relocation and the university's stance on accepting Japanese students during the war. The University of Idaho holds a long commitment to overcoming the obstacles to world peace, particularly through the work of The Borah Foundation & Symposium. And like Hiroshima University, the Foundation has planted trees in their efforts, creating the Borah International Peace Grove. The journey to peace is long, many of us remain on the continuous path towards it, and it is our hope that by remembering the struggles and failures of our past we may come together again at the end.",2021,,peace; trees,University of Idaho Arboretum,,,1997_WeepingWhiteMulberry_01,,Photograph,image/jpg,image;stillimage,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.
