Ernest Day was an Idaho conservationist from Boise with an interest in nature photography. He served as president of The Idaho Wildlife Federation from 1961 to 1963 and on the national board of The Wilderness Society.

His photograph of Castle Peak in the White Cloud Mountains was published in a full page ad paid by conservationists in the Idaho Statesman on August 2, 1970. It is said to have drawn attention to the cause of protection of the White Clouds and the call for integration of the mountains into the Sawtooth National Recreation Area. Publicity surrounding the photo helped to stop a mining company from exploring the area. Democrat Cecil Andrus, impressed by the allure of the photograph, embraced this cause during his successful political campaign for Governor of Idaho in 1970. Later the photograph appeared on the cover of Life Magazine. The White Cloud Mountains became part of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area in 1972. In 1981 Day received the Ansel Adams Award from The Sierra Club, which honors superlative photography that has been used to further conservation causes.

Day also joined with other activists in support of the protection of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area. He died on 12 February 2008 at the age of 89.


Served on the Board of Directors of the National Wildlife Federation, was president of the Idaho Wildlife Federation and chairman of the Idaho Park Board. [2]

"mammoth preservation efforts like the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness and the Wilderness Act itself are at the very least partially due to Day's passion and involvement."

The photographs influenced Cecil Andrus. Credited with helping influence Senator Frank Church, who sponsored the 1964 Wilderness Act.
