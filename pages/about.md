# Ernie Day 

Ernest E. Day was a businessman, conservationist and photographer. Born in 1918, he was raised in Boise. After earning a B.A. in Political Science from the University of Idaho, he went on to serve in the Army Air Corp during World War II. Upon his return, he went to work for this family's business Day Realty. After years contributing to conservation work in Idaho, Day died in 2008 at the age of 89.

Day had a passion for Idaho's nature. He was a member of several conservation organizations, serving as president of the Idaho Wildlife Federation, chairman of the Idaho Park Board, and serving on the Board of Directors for the National Wildlife Federation. He worked with other activists in efforts to preserve the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, and even influenced Senator Frank Church to support the 1964 Wilderness Act.

Day is quoted as having often said "Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints" when it came to Idaho's nature.[^1] One of his greatest contributions to Idaho's conservation efforts were his photographs. He often took photographs of the scenic beauty of Idaho while on hikes and trips with his family. In 1970, one of his photographs was published in the Idaho Statesman as a full page ad by conservationists to help promote the protection of Idaho's lands. This photograph of Castle Peak in the White Cloud Mountains drew attention to the cause of protecting the White Clouds and the call to integrate them into the Sawtooth Recreation Area. A cause that was used by Democrat Cecil Adrus in his successful campaign for governor in 1970. The Castle Peak photograph would go on to appear on the cover of Life Magazine and the White Cloud Mountains would ultimately become a part of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area in 1972. More of Day's photographs would appear in various publications, including *Field & Stream*, *Sports Illustrated*, *American Forest Magazine*, and the *Sierra Club Bulletin*.[^2]
