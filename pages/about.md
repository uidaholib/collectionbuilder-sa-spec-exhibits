## About the Collection

University of Idaho General Catalogs collection provides access to digitized copies of historic catalogs held by Special Collections and Archives.
Written and published each year, these documents are a useful source of historic information about campus and the university as it was presented to contemporary students and staff.

The General Catalog is the primary source for all degree requirements, academic regulations, course descriptions, and services offered by the University. 
A new General Catalog is published annually and is effective starting in the summer. 
Every effort is made to ensure the Catalog is accurate as of the date of publication.[^1]

To view current General Catalogs, please visit the [current U of I Catalogs page](https://www.uidaho.edu/registrar/classes/catalogs).
